# console-3d
Console 3D from scratch<br>

- This code is work in progress and is not refactored. In fact I would do a lot of things differently if I have to code it again.
- To run it on Windows 11 or higher you need to set your default terminal to "Windows Console Host"

- Rendering .obj 3D models
- Playing chiptunes (.mod, .xm, .s3m, .it) using the BASSMOD library (https://www.un4seen.com/)
