# console-3d
Console 3D from scratch<br>
Rendering ASCII characters in the Windows Command Prompt, 30 frames per second.

## Note
This code is work in progress and is not refactored. In fact I would do a lot of things differently if I have to code it again.

## Features
- Rendering .obj format 3D models
- Playing chiptunes (.mod, .xm, .s3m, .it) using the BASSMOD library (https://www.un4seen.com/)
- Component object system based scenes
